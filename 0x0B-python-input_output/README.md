# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

This project is about input and output in Python. We will learn how to open, read, write and append files. We will also learn how to use the `with` statement and the `json` module.

## Files

- [0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py) - Function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout.

- [1-write_file.py](1-write_file.py) - Function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.

- [2-append_write.py](2-append_write.py) - Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added.

- [3-to_json_string.py](3-to_json_string.py) - Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

- [4-from_json_string.py](4-from_json_string.py) - Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.

- [5-save_to_json_file.py](5-save_to_json_file.py) - Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.

- [6-load_from_json_file.py](6-load_from_json_file.py) - Function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”.

- [7-add_item.py](7-add_item.py) - Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file.

- [8-class_to_json.py](8-class_to_json.py) - Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.

- [9-student.py](9-student.py) - Class `Student` that defines a student by: `first_name`, `last_name` and `age`.

- [10-student.py](10-student.py) - Class `Student` that defines a student by: `first_name`, `last_name` and `age`. It also retrieves a dictionary representation of a `Student` instance.

- [11-student.py](11-student.py) - Class `Student` that defines a student by: `first_name`, `last_name` and `age`. It also retrieves a dictionary representation of a `Student` instance. It also retrieves a JSON representation of a `Student` instance.

- [12-pascal_triangle.py](12-pascal_triangle.py) - Function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`.

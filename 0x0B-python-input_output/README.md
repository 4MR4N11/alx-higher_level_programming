# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

This project is about input and output in Python. We will learn how to open, read, write and append files. We will also learn how to use the `with` statement and the `json` module.

## Files

- [0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py) - Function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout.

- [1-write_file.py](1-write_file.py) - Function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.
